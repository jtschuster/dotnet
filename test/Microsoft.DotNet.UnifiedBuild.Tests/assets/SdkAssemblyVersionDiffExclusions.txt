# Contains the list of files whose assembly versions are to be excluded from comparison between the MSFT & SB SDK.
# These exclusions only take effect if the assembly version of the file in the SB SDK is equal to or greater than
# the version in the MSFT SDK. If the version is less, the file will show up in the results as this is not a scenario
# that is valid for shipping.
#
# This list is processed using FileSystemName.MatchesSimpleExpression
#
# Examples
# 'folder/*' matches 'folder/' and 'folder/abc'
# 'folder/?*' matches 'folder/abc' but not 'folder/'
#
# We do not want to filter-out folder entries, therefore, we should use: '?*' and not just '*'
